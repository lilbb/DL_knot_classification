# DL_knot_classification
This is a project to create a classifier for human-tied knots with deep learning.
This project used 1080+110=1190 knot images as a data set.
The project used ResNet as the Baseline and compared the model performance with Visual Transformer and EfficientNet. The Optuna library was used for hyperparameter optimization in ViT and EfficientNet.
The project also includes some visualizations.
